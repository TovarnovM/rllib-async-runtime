# Architecture boundary

The project is a thin Ray-native runtime around RLlib components, not a new
implementation of SAC.

The central design is:

> Authoritative episode store + learner-specific materialized replay views.

Phase 0 verified the RLlib seams that later phases depend on:

- a single-environment `SingleAgentEnvRunner` can return one complete episode;
- a local SAC `LearnerGroup` can update from replay-sampled episodes;
- inference weights can be installed between complete episodes;
- module, target-network, optimizer, and SAC temperature state can be restored;
- a standard RLlib `Algorithm` eagerly owns a control plane that the custom
  runtime must instead compose explicitly.

Phase 1 adds the process-boundary contracts and a deterministic in-process
correctness oracle:

- immutable, schema-versioned whole-episode envelopes;
- idempotent FIFO storage bounded by transitions and approximate bytes;
- atomic add/evict transactions, snapshots, deltas, and resync cursors;
- a materialized reference replay that samples uniformly over transitions.

It still contains no Ray replay actor, asynchronous execution loop, hierarchy,
or graph encoder.
